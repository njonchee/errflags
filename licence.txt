      Copyright (C) 2000..2006 applies. All Rights Reserved.

      The No-Nonsense Licence Statement
      =================================
      This software and everything enclosed with it are protected by both
      Belgian copyright law and international treaty provisions.
      It is called "openware".

      OPENWARE software may be copied and distributed freely IF:

           *  NO FEE IS CHARGED FOR USE, COPYING OR DISTRIBUTION
              (you may recover media and postage expenses, however)

           *  IT IS NOT MODIFIED IN ANY WAY.

      It may be distributed ONLY in its original, unmodified compressed
      package file.

      This means you may not add comments to the compressed package file
      (also known as an archive file or simply an archive), nor may you
      delete files from or add files to the archive file, UNLESS YOU HAVE
      A WRITTEN PERMISSION TO DO SO.

      Converting the archive file to another compression method or
      another archive file format is allowed, provided that the above
      conditions are met.

      If you can make valuable contributions or modifications to the
      enclosed source code, you are welcome to do so but please send
      them to me (see below) and do not distribute your own version
      of the program. That would only create confusion and you would
      be violating this licence. If your code is incorporated into the
      program, rest assured you will be given due credit.

      The original package as released by me is in the Russian ARchive
      format RAR.
      In order to extract the files from an RAR archive under any operating
      system, you will need to get the RAR program for that OS.
      At the time this is written, the RAR program's latest version is 2.80
      and it is available for DOS, 32-bit Windows, OS/2, Linux and other
      systems. See http://www.rarsoft.com on the Internet.
      Note, that recompressing the archive could result in a larger file.


      Warranty
      ========
      This software is provided AS IS without any warranty, expressed or
      implied, including but not limited to fitness for a particular
      purpose.
      IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR OF THIS PRODUCT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
      DIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGES WHICH MAY HAVE ARISEN
      FROM THE USE OF THIS PRODUCT.

      or if you do not agree with any of them yourself, THEN YOU ARE NOT
      LICENCED TO USE THIS PROGRAM!
