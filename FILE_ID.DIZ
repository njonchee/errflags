ErrFlags v2.15 checks/corrects fidonodelist
New in this version:
- User flag length increase from 32 to 40.
Last time, in Version 2.14:
- Space and tail comma removals are now counted (that means, only the
  number of entries in which they occur are counted) and the node
  number of the offending entry is shown so the originator of the
  nodelist segment can correct the errors more easily.
